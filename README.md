# Nimbus Solutions — Responsive Company Website

This is a small, mobile-first responsive company website template created for a web-development internship task.

## Files
- `index.html` — main HTML page
- `style.css` — mobile-first CSS with desktop media queries
- `images/` — small SVG assets (logo + illustration)

## How to use
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Replace text, images, and links with your real content if needed.
3. Test responsiveness by resizing the browser or using DevTools.

## Notes
- Navigation uses a checkbox-based toggle (no JavaScript).
- Images scale automatically on smaller screens.
